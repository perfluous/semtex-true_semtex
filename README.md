Energy weapons research.
Though the calculations are not complete yet, and it is purely theoretical. It does seem possible to fry brains, hearts, and specific organs from quite a range. If this is indeed true, which again I must verify. Then it might also be possible to explode brains with existing infrastructure. Time to get your tinfoil hats y'all LOL. Imagine a energy complex which fries everyone that comes close. It would be possible to lay down an enemy energy infrastructure + braindrain. Which would require huge investments (people, time, material, moneyz)) to recover from wtf lol.
If anyone does not want me to do this research please don't explode me, I'm just trying to have some fun. Just contact me, and if you're generous give me some funds to work on other projects.
There are SO MANY ways for destruction, I am often amazed that we have not destroyed ourselves yet. But perhaps this is due to my practical inexperience.
